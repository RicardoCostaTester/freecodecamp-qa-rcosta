# freecodecamp-qa-rcosta

This repository contains my work for the **Quality Assurance** lessons on freeCodeCamp. The exercises focus on testing concepts and using the Chai assertion library to write and validate tests. Each lesson builds foundational skills in QA practices, including unit testing, assertions, and test-driven development principles.

## Contents
- Setup for Chai testing
- Exercises to practice various types of assertions
- Examples of real-world testing scenarios
